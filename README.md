## Who
After half of our team deserting, we are a team of two, Marek Otahal, a computer science student and Alžběta Krejčová, a psychology student.

## Why
Beacuse we are at Hackaton and want to try and learn something new ;) Our first project would transform brainwaves into sensory signals (vibrations), our second projest was designed to help our fellow hackatoners.

## What
1. First project was to create a vest with vibration motors, that would vibrate accoring to data from eeg.

2.Second project was to create a visualisation of beta to alpha waves ratio. With this we have been also looking into cordance and corcondance and its use in detecting depression.


## How
During the project we have been battling a lot with practical difficulties of the project. We think that some of these can be the greatest contribution to other groups, to know what to prepare (for) before hand.

Main difficulty that it is not easy to read EEG data, even people with lots of expereince are not sure of what they are seeing a lot of the time. Therefore to see a result, when you are working with eeg data for two days is near to impossible. In my opinion the greatest danger though lies in someone inexperienced looking at the data and thinking that they are seeing something and using it as a proof. For example, we created filers in OpenVibe that allowed us to see only waves of some frequency (roughtly beta, alpha..). When we opened one adn tried the mental state that should have been asiciated with it, we did "see" it. But when we opened all four at once, we could always see all of the waves. So since the waves are dynamic, you can always see some sort of rise or down going and it is very easy to psesudo-link it with anything that you imagine.
